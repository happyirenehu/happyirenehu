[Top 3 Ranked] - 2022 iThome Ironman Challenge (Technical Engagement)

"I don't just build systems; I bridge the gap between complex logic and human understanding. My tutorials are trusted by over 100,000 developers for their logical clarity and No-Nonsense implementation."
### 🧗 "Engineering is a Crux: I solve it with precision, not brute force."

I am a **Backend Developer** and a **Relentless Self-Learner**. My path into tech wasn't a straight line—it was a technical climb. From self-funding my Computer Science degree to mastering complex systems independently, I am built to solve what others find "too difficult."

---

## 🚀 Technical Persona
- **Precision Over Power:** I tackle **5.11 rock climbing routes** with technical finesse rather than brute force. I bring this same philosophy to backend architecture: I don't write "heavy" code; I engineer **efficient, clean, and stable logic.**
- **The "BTV" Mindset:** Just as I self-taught **Freediving (BTV/10m)** by mastering micro-internal controls, I possess a natural intuition for debugging deep-level system issues and optimizing SQL performance.
- **Autonomous & Documentation-Driven:** No teacher? No problem. I’ve been "dead-clenching" (**死磕**) official documentation since 2016. From **Harp/Piano** to **Heavy Trucks**, if it has a manual, I can master it.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python (Django, DRF), RESTful APIs
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL (Optimization & Schema Design)
- **Infrastructure:** AWS (EC2, S3), Docker, Git
- **Problem Solving:** Root-cause analysis & Legacy code refactoring

---

## 🌊 Beyond the Code
- **Rock Climbing (5.11):** Where I learned that persistence and balance are the ultimate algorithms.
- **Freediving (BTV Proficient):** A discipline of maintaining absolute calmness under extreme pressure.
- **Heavy Machinery:** Licensed **Heavy Truck** driver—I'm comfortable managing high-stakes, complex tools.
- **Music:** Harp & Piano (The origin of my discipline and technical precision).

---

## 📈 My Philosophy
> "I don't just fix bugs; I hunt them down. I might take my time to ensure **100% precision**, but I will never let go of the rope until I reach the top."

- 📫 **Reach me at:** [REDACTED]
- 💼 **Available for:** Global Remote Backend Projects | Specialized Django Development
